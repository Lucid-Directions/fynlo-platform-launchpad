# 🚀 Fynlo Portal Implementation Status

## 📋 Overall Progress Tracking

**Document Reference**: [Portal Alignment Implementation Guide](README.md)

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundational Architecture (COMPLETED)

### 1. API Configuration and Base Service ✅
- ✅ Created `src/config/api.config.ts` with complete endpoint mapping
- ✅ Built `src/services/api/baseApi.ts` with error handling and auth integration
- ✅ Separated 🏪 Restaurant Manager endpoints from 👤 Platform Owner endpoints
- ✅ Implemented helper functions for URL parameter replacement

### 2. Updated Authentication Flow ✅
- ✅ Enhanced AuthContext with restaurant details and permissions
- ✅ Added support for distinguishing platform owners vs restaurant managers
- ✅ Maintained existing subscription management functionality

### 3. Routing Structure for Both Dashboards ✅
- ✅ Created `src/components/routing/RouteGuards.tsx` with role-based access
- ✅ Built `src/components/platform/PlatformLayout.tsx` for platform owners
- ✅ Created `src/components/platform/dashboard/PlatformOverview.tsx`
- ✅ Updated `src/App.tsx` with separated routing:
  - 🏪 `/restaurant/*` - Restaurant Manager Dashboard
  - 👤 `/platform/*` - Platform Owner Dashboard
- ✅ Updated existing `Dashboard.tsx` component for restaurant context

---

## 🎯 Current Implementation State

### What's Working Now:
1. **Two Separate Dashboards**: Platform owners and restaurant managers get different interfaces
2. **Proper Route Protection**: Users are automatically directed to the correct dashboard
3. **API Foundation**: Complete endpoint structure ready for backend integration
4. **Existing Features Preserved**: All current functionality (settings, subscriptions) maintained

### User Flow:
- **Restaurant Owner**: Logs in → `/restaurant/dashboard` (sees ONLY their data)
- **Platform Owner**: Logs in → `/platform/dashboard` (sees ALL restaurants data)
- **Automatic Redirects**: Users can't access the wrong dashboard type

## 🔄 API Migration Strategy

### Current Status:
- **Supabase Direct Queries**: Still in use (legacy)
- **API Service**: Created but not yet implemented
- **Authentication**: Uses Supabase auth + enhanced user data

### Migration Plan:
1. **Phase 2**: Keep Supabase queries, add API calls incrementally
2. **Phase 3**: Begin replacing Supabase queries with API calls
3. **Phase 4**: Complete migration to backend API

---

## 🎨 Preserved Existing Features

### ✅ What We Kept:
- **Subscription Management**: Complete plan selection interface in restaurant settings
- **Authentication System**: Existing Supabase auth flow

- **UI/UX**: Maintained design consistency and component library

### 🔄 What We Enhanced:
- **Route Structure**: More organized and role-based
- **User Context**: Enhanced with restaurant details and permissions
- **Access Control**: Proper separation between platform and restaurant features
